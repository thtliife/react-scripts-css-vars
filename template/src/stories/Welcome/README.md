# Welcome to STORYBOOK

[STORYBOOK](https://getstorybook.io/) is a UI component dev environment for your app.

We've added some basic stories inside the _**src/stories**_ directory.
A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
(Basically a story is like a visual test case.)

See the provided sample stories for a component called _**Button**_.

Just like that, you can add your own components as stories.
You can also edit those components and see changes right away.
(Try editing the Button component located at _**src/stories/Button/button-component.jsx**_.)

This is just one thing you can do with Storybook.
Have a look at the [React Storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook) repo for more information.
